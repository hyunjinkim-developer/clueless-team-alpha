"""
WebSocket consumer for the Clue-Less game, handling real-time interactions.

This module defines the GameConsumer, an AsyncWebsocketConsumer that manages
WebSocket connections for the multiplayer game. It handles connection establishment,
disconnection, message processing, and game state updates, supporting features like
dynamic player updates, game start, moves, suggestions, and accusations. The consumer
validates sessions using cookies, ensures authenticated users via Channels middleware,
and broadcasts game state changes to clients, integrating with fixes for session
overwrites, AttributeError at /login/, and lobby functionality (dynamic updates, start
button, reload fixes).

Key features:
- Validates session cookies (sessionid, clueless_*) to ensure session integrity.
- Uses Channels middleware (SessionMiddlewareStack, AuthMiddlewareStack) for
  authentication, ensuring self.scope['user'] is set correctly.
- Broadcasts player_joined and game_started events for real-time lobby updates.
- Manages game logic with turn restrictions and card distribution.
- Supports debugging with detailed logging when DEBUG is enabled.

    prevent unauthorized access. Broadcasts events like player_joined and game_started

        Validates the session using the sessionid cookie, retrieves user data, joins the
        game group, sends the initial game state, and broadcasts a player_joined event.
        Closes the connection if session validation fails, ensuring security.

        - **Authentication**: Uses self.scope['user'] set by AuthMiddlewareStack in
          asgi.py to identify the authenticated user. Ensures only authenticated users
          connect, aligning with views.py authentication checks.
        - **Session Handling**: Retrieves the sessionid cookie and validates it against
          the django_session table. Loads session data to check for expected_username,
          mirroring SessionValidationMiddlewareâ€™s logic to prevent session overwrites.
          Stores session_data in self.scope['session'] for use in other methods.
        - **Error Handling**: Closes the connection (code 4001) if the sessionid is
          missing, invalid, or lacks expected_username, preventing unauthorized access.
        - **Debugging**: Logs cookie details and session validation status when
